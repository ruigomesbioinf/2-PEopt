# Optimisation of phenylethanol production in Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Escherichia coli
GitHub repository to support the development of the project "Optimisation of phenylethanol production in Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Escherichia coli"

### Introduction
<div style = "text-align: justify;">
  The increasing search for sustainable methods and processes that optimize the production of some so-called biological targets created a demand in the scientific community to gather and develop different tools. These tools excel at being sustainable and economical efficient, leaving behind the traditional methods of chemical synthesis and replacing them with biotechnological approaches. Therefore, in silico optimization tools have been developed all around the world to provide answers to one of the major challenges of Metabolic Engineering, develop models and algorithms to identify an ensemble of genetic modifications that will translate itself into an optimal strain with the desired phenotype. Most of the time, this means we are searching for the set of modifications that will make the organism have a high yield/production of some target metabolite.
